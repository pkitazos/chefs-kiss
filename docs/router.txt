# Pages Structure

## Overview
- Root-level pages implicitly refer to the current/upcoming event
- Past events explicitly live under /events/[slug]
- Pages are manually enabled/disabled through the event lifecycle via rebuilds

## Event Lifecycle Phases
1. Post-event (1-2 weeks): Shows recent past event info
2. Hibernation: "Coming soon" homepage
3. Vendor applications open
4. Vendors finalized → vendor list goes live
5. Workshops finalized → workshop pages go live
6. Event details finalized → map, dishes, schedule go live
